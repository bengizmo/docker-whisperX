111	2100	into the industry, discussing all things HVAC.
3078	5165	from storytelling to technical discussion.
5707	6290	Enjoy the show.
11310	13408	All right, Rachel, the first question I'm gonna ask you is
14114	16630	How did you come up with the name Miss Mini Split?
16750	18815	I was doing a lot of mini splits at the time.
18835	18915	Yeah.
20433	21590	And I was...
21953	23900	I'm trying to think of an Instagram.
23940	24803	I decided to make an Instagram.
24803	25107	Have a great day.
25980	28533	And I just happened to be doing many splits, and I was like, oh, that's
28533	29179	That sounds catchy.
29502	30350	That's what I came up with.
31081	33643	So we're going to talk the audience that's listening right now.
33723	36610	now we're going to talk about the installation of a mini split.
37364	39118	and Rachel and I will go through it together.
39720	42028	And if you guys are new to the trade newer to the trader
42228	45070	or you're just looking for tips to make your installs go a little bit
45130	45372	better.
45896	47909	I'm sure the conversation will help with that.
48682	48784	So...
49430	51515	You got a car seat in the back of your work truck.
51756	52505	explain so.
53815	54969	Like obviously you have a
55313	57907	a young child and you got to maybe drop off to
58208	59276	daycare or something like that.
59296	59759	Yeah, exactly.
59779	60826	Once in a while on your way to work.
61068	62660	Yes, that's exactly the routine.
64317	66968	I've seen a post where you actually brought your kid to work.
67256	67465	Yes.
68131	69095	How did that all come about?
69116	70542	Because that's interesting to me, right?
70703	72256	Yeah, so I made
72658	74963	my instagram miss minisplit in the summer of
75023	75448	2023 by that time I
77028	79405	I've already been doing HVAC for like 10 years.
79813	81251	All right, and before that, you know
81452	83138	just been out here doing my things.
83420	84716	not on social media.
85526	88456	But I think I was pregnant or I had just had my baby.
88577	90630	Yeah that's right I was pregnant with my second kid.
90791	92746	by the time I made my Miss Mini Split Instagram.
93582	95821	And so I was kind of like working part time.
96694	98912	And the only reason why I was working part-time was
99012	101467	because I had already been working full-
101632	101984	time.
102525	104357	for a bunch of general contractors.
104538	106421	had all these customers and I told
106502	109197	them and I tried to keep telling them, you know,
110188	112804	I'm not working right now, and they would just
112986	113474	Beg me.
114014	116686	Say, please come, just bring your baby.
117221	119604	You know, it'll be fine and I'm like, ah, I don't
119624	121252	I really like doing that, but...
121452	123137	you know, sometimes some customers.
123708	125053	You just got to take care of them.
125153	126317	So it got to the point.
126458	128370	where I was like, fine, I'll just bring my kid.
129009	131467	and I would bring my mom with me so she would kind of help.
131711	132570	watch my kid.
133306	135426	Sometimes it was as young as three months old.
135728	138457	So she would be there watching the kid while I work and I would take a break.
138498	138843	break.
139644	142270	you know, take care of my kid, you know, change her diaper.
143033	145025	or feed her and that sort of thing.
145995	146381	Interesting.
147170	149831	The struggles of being a mom sometimes, huh?
151336	153481	I shouldn't say I get it because I'm not a mom, but I
153982	155847	I got three kids of my own so I get
156169	157181	Yeah, yeah, then the whole
158137	160607	Yeah, I get the whole family dynamic and having to
161109	163979	balance your life and struggle and make sure that your kids
164039	165774	come first, but you also got to
166209	167424	work and maintain a living.
167787	169734	and to bring in that income so you can buy food and
170337	172973	like a home and a bed for yourself and your kids and stuff.
173073	173275	too.
173315	175430	So I commend the fact that you worked
175741	177039	that hard to make it work.
178200	178685	Pretty cool.
178967	179977	Now, where are you located?
180178	181349	You're located in California, right?
181470	182258	Yes, San Diego.
182481	183438	San Diego, okay.
184374	187023	So when it comes to, you're doing a lot of mini splits.
187145	187818	So is that?
188598	190387	side of the industry taken off a lot in
190927	193125	California and San Diego like the mini split.
193452	194001	side of things?
195358	196609	And the reason for that is...
197275	199805	because of the housing crisis out here.
200431	202502	And because of the housing crisis, there's a huge
202643	204185	push for affordable housing.
204677	207158	Well, if you want affordable housing, you have to build
207863	209457	it affordably to begin with.
209738	212465	or else you can't rent it out for an affordable price.
212605	212774	Thank you.
213330	215776	And so part of that is finding affordable trades.
216378	218168	of affordable HVAC systems.
218489	221176	and so there is a huge demand for Mini Split.
221397	222904	systems right now out here.
223158	226085	Yeah, well, it makes sense because if you think about a centralized
226166	226470	system.
227104	228411	going into a unit or...
229611	231198	whatever it is that how they're
231339	232849	they're building or dividing the spaces.
233618	235952	duck work and all that, then you got to frame around it.
236434	236977	You know what I mean?
237258	238465	That costs a lot of money.
238626	240221	I was just speaking to somebody that wants.
240995	241762	that got a 1400 square foot home.
243405	244130	that they're building and
246148	248737	the quotes to get duck work and a furnace and all that in.
249419	250562	is upwards of $20,000 or more.
252431	253000	Yeah, no
253601	256319	you could throw in a mini-split for way less than that.
256901	257284	Exactly.
257999	260346	So it makes sense what you're saying, so it's a lot more.
260790	261783	affordable to the
262511	264608	I guess the general contractor that's putting it in.
265453	267750	And the thing with a mini-split these days
267911	270450	is they're very reliable like the technology behind
