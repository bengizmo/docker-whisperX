1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:02,100
[SPEAKER_02]: into the industry, discussing all things HVAC.

2
00:00:03,078 --> 00:00:05,165
[SPEAKER_02]: from storytelling to technical discussion.

3
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:06,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy the show.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,408
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Rachel, the first question I'm gonna ask you is

5
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,630
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you come up with the name Miss Mini Split?

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing a lot of mini splits at the time.

7
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:18,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

8
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was...

9
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:23,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of an Instagram.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided to make an Instagram.

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just happened to be doing many splits, and I was like, oh, that's

12
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:29,179
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds catchy.

13
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:30,350
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I came up with.

14
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,643
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk the audience that's listening right now.

15
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:36,610
[SPEAKER_02]: now we're going to talk about the installation of a mini split.

16
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:39,118
[SPEAKER_02]: and Rachel and I will go through it together.

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you guys are new to the trade newer to the trader

18
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:45,070
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're just looking for tips to make your installs go a little bit

19
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,372
[SPEAKER_02]: better.

20
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:47,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the conversation will help with that.

21
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:48,784
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

22
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,515
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a car seat in the back of your work truck.

23
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:52,505
[SPEAKER_02]: explain so.

24
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:54,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Like obviously you have a

25
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:57,907
[SPEAKER_02]: a young child and you got to maybe drop off to

26
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,276
[SPEAKER_02]: daycare or something like that.

27
00:00:59,296 --> 00:00:59,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

28
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:00,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a while on your way to work.

29
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:02,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's exactly the routine.

30
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:06,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a post where you actually brought your kid to work.

31
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:07,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

32
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,095
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that all come about?

33
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:10,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's interesting to me, right?

34
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I made

35
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:14,963
[SPEAKER_00]: my instagram miss minisplit in the summer of

36
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:15,448
[SPEAKER_00]: 2023 by that time I

37
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:19,405
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already been doing HVAC for like 10 years.

38
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,251
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and before that, you know

39
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:23,138
[SPEAKER_01]: just been out here doing my things.

40
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,716
[SPEAKER_01]: not on social media.

41
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:28,456
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I was pregnant or I had just had my baby.

42
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:30,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's right I was pregnant with my second kid.

43
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,746
[SPEAKER_01]: by the time I made my Miss Mini Split Instagram.

44
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:35,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was kind of like working part time.

45
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason why I was working part-time was

46
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,467
[SPEAKER_01]: because I had already been working full-

47
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:41,984
[SPEAKER_01]: time.

48
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:44,357
[SPEAKER_01]: for a bunch of general contractors.

49
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,421
[SPEAKER_01]: had all these customers and I told

50
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:49,197
[SPEAKER_01]: them and I tried to keep telling them, you know,

51
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:52,804
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not working right now, and they would just

52
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:53,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Beg me.

53
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, please come, just bring your baby.

54
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,604
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll be fine and I'm like, ah, I don't

55
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:01,252
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like doing that, but...

56
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:03,137
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sometimes some customers.

57
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,053
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to take care of them.

58
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So it got to the point.

59
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,370
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was like, fine, I'll just bring my kid.

60
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,467
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would bring my mom with me so she would kind of help.

61
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:12,570
[SPEAKER_01]: watch my kid.

62
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:15,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it was as young as three months old.

63
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:18,457
[SPEAKER_01]: So she would be there watching the kid while I work and I would take a break.

64
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:18,843
[SPEAKER_01]: break.

65
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:22,270
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, take care of my kid, you know, change her diaper.

66
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:25,025
[SPEAKER_01]: or feed her and that sort of thing.

67
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:26,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

68
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,831
[SPEAKER_02]: The struggles of being a mom sometimes, huh?

69
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:33,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say I get it because I'm not a mom, but I

70
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I got three kids of my own so I get

71
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:37,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, then the whole

72
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:40,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get the whole family dynamic and having to

73
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:43,979
[SPEAKER_02]: balance your life and struggle and make sure that your kids

74
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,774
[SPEAKER_02]: come first, but you also got to

75
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,424
[SPEAKER_02]: work and maintain a living.

76
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:49,734
[SPEAKER_02]: and to bring in that income so you can buy food and

77
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,973
[SPEAKER_02]: like a home and a bed for yourself and your kids and stuff.

78
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:53,275
[SPEAKER_02]: too.

79
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So I commend the fact that you worked

80
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,039
[SPEAKER_02]: that hard to make it work.

81
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

82
00:02:58,967 --> 00:02:59,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, where are you located?

83
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:01,349
[SPEAKER_02]: You're located in California, right?

84
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, San Diego.

85
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:03,438
[SPEAKER_02]: San Diego, okay.

86
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:07,023
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to, you're doing a lot of mini splits.

87
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:07,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that?

88
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:10,387
[SPEAKER_02]: side of the industry taken off a lot in

89
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:13,125
[SPEAKER_02]: California and San Diego like the mini split.

90
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:14,001
[SPEAKER_02]: side of things?

91
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:16,609
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is...

92
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:19,805
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the housing crisis out here.

93
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:22,502
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the housing crisis, there's a huge

94
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,185
[SPEAKER_01]: push for affordable housing.

95
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:27,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you want affordable housing, you have to build

96
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:29,457
[SPEAKER_01]: it affordably to begin with.

97
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:32,465
[SPEAKER_01]: or else you can't rent it out for an affordable price.

98
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of that is finding affordable trades.

99
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:38,168
[SPEAKER_01]: of affordable HVAC systems.

100
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,176
[SPEAKER_01]: and so there is a huge demand for Mini Split.

101
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:42,904
[SPEAKER_01]: systems right now out here.

102
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, it makes sense because if you think about a centralized

103
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:46,470
[SPEAKER_02]: system.

104
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:48,411
[SPEAKER_02]: going into a unit or...

105
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:51,198
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is that how they're

106
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:52,849
[SPEAKER_02]: they're building or dividing the spaces.

107
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:55,952
[SPEAKER_02]: duck work and all that, then you got to frame around it.

108
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:56,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

109
00:03:57,258 --> 00:03:58,465
[SPEAKER_02]: That costs a lot of money.

110
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:00,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just speaking to somebody that wants.

111
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:01,762
[SPEAKER_02]: that got a 1400 square foot home.

112
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:04,130
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're building and

113
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:08,737
[SPEAKER_02]: the quotes to get duck work and a furnace and all that in.

114
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,562
[SPEAKER_02]: is upwards of $20,000 or more.

115
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no

116
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,319
[SPEAKER_02]: you could throw in a mini-split for way less than that.

117
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:17,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

118
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:20,346
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes sense what you're saying, so it's a lot more.

119
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,783
[SPEAKER_02]: affordable to the

120
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the general contractor that's putting it in.

121
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:27,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing with a mini-split these days

122
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:30,450
[SPEAKER_02]: is they're very reliable like the technology behind
