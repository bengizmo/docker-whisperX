WEBVTT

00:00.111 --> 00:02.100
[SPEAKER_02]: into the industry, discussing all things HVAC.

00:03.078 --> 00:05.165
[SPEAKER_02]: from storytelling to technical discussion.

00:05.707 --> 00:06.290
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy the show.

00:11.310 --> 00:13.408
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Rachel, the first question I'm gonna ask you is

00:14.114 --> 00:16.630
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you come up with the name Miss Mini Split?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.815
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing a lot of mini splits at the time.

00:18.835 --> 00:18.915
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

00:20.433 --> 00:21.590
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was...

00:21.953 --> 00:23.900
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of an Instagram.

00:23.940 --> 00:24.803
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided to make an Instagram.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.533
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just happened to be doing many splits, and I was like, oh, that's

00:28.533 --> 00:29.179
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds catchy.

00:29.502 --> 00:30.350
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I came up with.

00:31.081 --> 00:33.643
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk the audience that's listening right now.

00:33.723 --> 00:36.610
[SPEAKER_02]: now we're going to talk about the installation of a mini split.

00:37.364 --> 00:39.118
[SPEAKER_02]: and Rachel and I will go through it together.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.028
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you guys are new to the trade newer to the trader

00:42.228 --> 00:45.070
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're just looking for tips to make your installs go a little bit

00:45.130 --> 00:45.372
[SPEAKER_02]: better.

00:45.896 --> 00:47.909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the conversation will help with that.

00:48.682 --> 00:48.784
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

00:49.430 --> 00:51.515
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a car seat in the back of your work truck.

00:51.756 --> 00:52.505
[SPEAKER_02]: explain so.

00:53.815 --> 00:54.969
[SPEAKER_02]: Like obviously you have a

00:55.313 --> 00:57.907
[SPEAKER_02]: a young child and you got to maybe drop off to

00:58.208 --> 00:59.276
[SPEAKER_02]: daycare or something like that.

00:59.296 --> 00:59.759
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

00:59.779 --> 01:00.826
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a while on your way to work.

01:01.068 --> 01:02.660
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's exactly the routine.

01:04.317 --> 01:06.968
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a post where you actually brought your kid to work.

01:07.256 --> 01:07.465
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

01:08.131 --> 01:09.095
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that all come about?

01:09.116 --> 01:10.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's interesting to me, right?

01:10.703 --> 01:12.256
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I made

01:12.658 --> 01:14.963
[SPEAKER_00]: my instagram miss minisplit in the summer of

01:15.023 --> 01:15.448
[SPEAKER_00]: 2023 by that time I

01:17.028 --> 01:19.405
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already been doing HVAC for like 10 years.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.251
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and before that, you know

01:21.452 --> 01:23.138
[SPEAKER_01]: just been out here doing my things.

01:23.420 --> 01:24.716
[SPEAKER_01]: not on social media.

01:25.526 --> 01:28.456
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I was pregnant or I had just had my baby.

01:28.577 --> 01:30.630
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's right I was pregnant with my second kid.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.746
[SPEAKER_01]: by the time I made my Miss Mini Split Instagram.

01:33.582 --> 01:35.821
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was kind of like working part time.

01:36.694 --> 01:38.912
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason why I was working part-time was

01:39.012 --> 01:41.467
[SPEAKER_01]: because I had already been working full-

01:41.632 --> 01:41.984
[SPEAKER_01]: time.

01:42.525 --> 01:44.357
[SPEAKER_01]: for a bunch of general contractors.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.421
[SPEAKER_01]: had all these customers and I told

01:46.502 --> 01:49.197
[SPEAKER_01]: them and I tried to keep telling them, you know,

01:50.188 --> 01:52.804
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not working right now, and they would just

01:52.986 --> 01:53.474
[SPEAKER_01]: Beg me.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.686
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, please come, just bring your baby.

01:57.221 --> 01:59.604
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll be fine and I'm like, ah, I don't

01:59.624 --> 02:01.252
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like doing that, but...

02:01.452 --> 02:03.137
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sometimes some customers.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.053
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to take care of them.

02:05.153 --> 02:06.317
[SPEAKER_01]: So it got to the point.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.370
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was like, fine, I'll just bring my kid.

02:09.009 --> 02:11.467
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would bring my mom with me so she would kind of help.

02:11.711 --> 02:12.570
[SPEAKER_01]: watch my kid.

02:13.306 --> 02:15.426
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it was as young as three months old.

02:15.728 --> 02:18.457
[SPEAKER_01]: So she would be there watching the kid while I work and I would take a break.

02:18.498 --> 02:18.843
[SPEAKER_01]: break.

02:19.644 --> 02:22.270
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, take care of my kid, you know, change her diaper.

02:23.033 --> 02:25.025
[SPEAKER_01]: or feed her and that sort of thing.

02:25.995 --> 02:26.381
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

02:27.170 --> 02:29.831
[SPEAKER_02]: The struggles of being a mom sometimes, huh?

02:31.336 --> 02:33.481
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say I get it because I'm not a mom, but I

02:33.982 --> 02:35.847
[SPEAKER_02]: I got three kids of my own so I get

02:36.169 --> 02:37.181
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, then the whole

02:38.137 --> 02:40.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get the whole family dynamic and having to

02:41.109 --> 02:43.979
[SPEAKER_02]: balance your life and struggle and make sure that your kids

02:44.039 --> 02:45.774
[SPEAKER_02]: come first, but you also got to

02:46.209 --> 02:47.424
[SPEAKER_02]: work and maintain a living.

02:47.787 --> 02:49.734
[SPEAKER_02]: and to bring in that income so you can buy food and

02:50.337 --> 02:52.973
[SPEAKER_02]: like a home and a bed for yourself and your kids and stuff.

02:53.073 --> 02:53.275
[SPEAKER_02]: too.

02:53.315 --> 02:55.430
[SPEAKER_02]: So I commend the fact that you worked

02:55.741 --> 02:57.039
[SPEAKER_02]: that hard to make it work.

02:58.200 --> 02:58.685
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

02:58.967 --> 02:59.977
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, where are you located?

03:00.178 --> 03:01.349
[SPEAKER_02]: You're located in California, right?

03:01.470 --> 03:02.258
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, San Diego.

03:02.481 --> 03:03.438
[SPEAKER_02]: San Diego, okay.

03:04.374 --> 03:07.023
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to, you're doing a lot of mini splits.

03:07.145 --> 03:07.818
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that?

03:08.598 --> 03:10.387
[SPEAKER_02]: side of the industry taken off a lot in

03:10.927 --> 03:13.125
[SPEAKER_02]: California and San Diego like the mini split.

03:13.452 --> 03:14.001
[SPEAKER_02]: side of things?

03:15.358 --> 03:16.609
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is...

03:17.275 --> 03:19.805
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the housing crisis out here.

03:20.431 --> 03:22.502
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the housing crisis, there's a huge

03:22.643 --> 03:24.185
[SPEAKER_01]: push for affordable housing.

03:24.677 --> 03:27.158
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you want affordable housing, you have to build

03:27.863 --> 03:29.457
[SPEAKER_01]: it affordably to begin with.

03:29.738 --> 03:32.465
[SPEAKER_01]: or else you can't rent it out for an affordable price.

03:33.330 --> 03:35.776
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of that is finding affordable trades.

03:36.378 --> 03:38.168
[SPEAKER_01]: of affordable HVAC systems.

03:38.489 --> 03:41.176
[SPEAKER_01]: and so there is a huge demand for Mini Split.

03:41.397 --> 03:42.904
[SPEAKER_01]: systems right now out here.

03:43.158 --> 03:46.085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, it makes sense because if you think about a centralized

03:46.166 --> 03:46.470
[SPEAKER_02]: system.

03:47.104 --> 03:48.411
[SPEAKER_02]: going into a unit or...

03:49.611 --> 03:51.198
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is that how they're

03:51.339 --> 03:52.849
[SPEAKER_02]: they're building or dividing the spaces.

03:53.618 --> 03:55.952
[SPEAKER_02]: duck work and all that, then you got to frame around it.

03:56.434 --> 03:56.977
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

03:57.258 --> 03:58.465
[SPEAKER_02]: That costs a lot of money.

03:58.626 --> 04:00.221
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just speaking to somebody that wants.

04:00.995 --> 04:01.762
[SPEAKER_02]: that got a 1400 square foot home.

04:03.405 --> 04:04.130
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're building and

04:06.148 --> 04:08.737
[SPEAKER_02]: the quotes to get duck work and a furnace and all that in.

04:09.419 --> 04:10.562
[SPEAKER_02]: is upwards of $20,000 or more.

04:12.431 --> 04:13.000
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no

04:13.601 --> 04:16.319
[SPEAKER_02]: you could throw in a mini-split for way less than that.

04:16.901 --> 04:17.284
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

04:17.999 --> 04:20.346
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes sense what you're saying, so it's a lot more.

04:20.790 --> 04:21.783
[SPEAKER_02]: affordable to the

04:22.511 --> 04:24.608
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the general contractor that's putting it in.

04:25.453 --> 04:27.750
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing with a mini-split these days

04:27.911 --> 04:30.450
[SPEAKER_02]: is they're very reliable like the technology behind
