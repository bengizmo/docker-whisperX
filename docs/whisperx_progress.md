# WhisperX Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
Implementing WhisperX for transcription and diarization of HVAC podcast content, with specific focus on accurate speaker identification and timestamp alignment.

## Environment
- Host: Linux 6.8.0-52-generic
- GPUs: 2x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12GB) + Quadro RTX 4000 (8GB)
- CUDA: 12.6
- RAM: 256GB
- CPU: Ryzen Pro (32 threads)

## Progress Timeline

### Initial Setup
1. Successfully built base Docker image with WhisperX
2. Verified NVIDIA Container Toolkit functionality
3. Confirmed GPU access from container with nvidia-smi

### Attempted Solutions

#### Attempt 1: Basic WhisperX Run
- Model: distil-large-v3
- Result: Successful transcription but failed diarization
- Error: `TypeError: Pipeline.from_pretrained() got an unexpected keyword argument 'segmentation_min_dur_on'`

#### Attempt 2: Diarization Pipeline Modification
- Modified diarize.py to use proper pyannote configuration
- Changes:
  ```python
  self.model.instantiate({
      "segmentation": {
          "min_duration_on": 0.1,
          "threshold": 0.45,
          "min_duration_off": 0.1
      },
      "clustering": {
          "threshold": 0.75,
          "min_duration_off": 0.1
      }
  })
  ```
- Status: Implementation complete, testing in progress

#### Attempt 3: CUDA Version Alignment
- Switched to CUDA 11.7.1 base image
- Installed PyTorch 2.0.1 with CUDA 11.7 support
- Added PyAnnote 3.1.0 with specific version requirements
- Status: Implementation complete, testing in progress

## Current Challenges
1. PyAnnote version compatibility with newer torch versions
2. Model version conflicts between WhisperX and PyAnnote
3. CUDA runtime library dependencies
4. Diarization accuracy and speaker separation

## Next Steps
1. Test modified diarization pipeline with CUDA 11.7
2. Evaluate diarization accuracy with new configuration
3. Consider implementing speaker embedding caching
4. Optimize chunk size and VAD parameters

## Technical Notes
- Using CUDA 11.7.1 for better PyAnnote compatibility
- PyTorch 2.0.1 selected for stability with PyAnnote 3.1.0
- Diarization parameters tuned for better speaker separation
- GPU memory optimization via proper CUDA configuration

## Dependencies
- PyTorch 2.0.1+cu117
- PyAnnote Audio 3.1.0
- CUDA 11.7.1
- FFmpeg (via static build)

## Known Issues
1. Version compatibility warnings:
   ```
   Model was trained with pyannote.audio 0.0.1, yours is 3.1.0
   Model was trained with torch 1.10.0+cu102, yours is 2.0.1+cu117
   ```
2. TF32 warnings from PyTorch
3. Diarization accuracy needs improvement

## Optimization Goals
1. Improve speaker diarization accuracy
2. Reduce GPU memory usage
3. Maintain transcription quality while improving processing speed
4. Handle overlapping speech more effectively
